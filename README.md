# Webview

A (new!) Java port of the [webview project](https://github.com/webview/webview). It uses JNA under the hood to interface with the webview library.

## How to use

1. Include the libary in your project (see the [JitPack page](https://jitpack.io/#Casterlabs/webview)).
2. Copy and run the example in `Example.java`.
3. Profit!

## Examples
[Example](https://github.com/Casterlabs/Webview/blob/main/Example.java)  
[Swing/AWT Example](https://github.com/Casterlabs/Webview/blob/main/SwingExample.java)

## MacOS

MacOS requires that all UI code be executed from the first thread, which means you will need to launch Java with `-XstartOnFirstThread`. This also means that the Webview AWT helper will NOT work at all.

## TODO

Build our own DLLs and whatnot, the current ones are copied from the Kotlin port.
